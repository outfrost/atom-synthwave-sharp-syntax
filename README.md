# Synthwave Sharp

A syntax theme for Atom.

Forked from [gilbertohasnofb](https://atom.io/users/gilbertohasnofb)'s [Synthwave Neo](https://atom.io/themes/synthwave-neo-syntax), sharpened and tweaked.

I've added a darkened background for [minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap) as well, for easier reading of shorter files.
